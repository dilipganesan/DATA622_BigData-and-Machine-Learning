This file contains answer for the Critical Thinking questions.

Critical Thinking (2 points total) Modify this ReadMe file to answer the following questions directly in place.
1. Kaggle changes links/ file locations/login process/ file content
2. We run out of space on HD / local permissions issue - can't save files
3. Someone updated python packages and there is unintended effect (functions retired or act differently)
4. Docker issues - lost internet within docker due to some ip binding to vm or local routing issues( 
I guess this falls under lost internet, but I am talking more if docker is the cause rather then ISP)
